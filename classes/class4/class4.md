- Presentation by Charles Corey
- Homework 2, briefly

## Otonality and Utonality
In a nutshell, the overtone series and the undertone series. Just as the harmonic series goes up, so it can come down.

### Otonality
- The first six notes in the overtone series (corrected for $\frac{2}{1}$ with duplicates eliminated) are:

$$
\text{ }\\
\frac{1}{1} \text{ - } \frac{3}{2} \text{ - } \frac{5}{4}
$$

- What does it sound like?

### Otonality
- The first six notes in the overtone series (corrected for $\frac{2}{1}$ with duplicates eliminated) are:

$$
\text{ }\\
\frac{1}{1} \text{ - } \frac{3}{2} \text{ - } \frac{5}{4}
$$

- What does it sound like?

Like a "major" chord.

---

### Utonality
- Implies "minor"
- The first six notes in the undertone series (corrected for $\frac{2}{1}$ with duplicates eliminated) are:

$$
\text{ }\\
\frac{1}{1} \text{ - } \frac{4}{3} \text{ - } \frac{8}{5}
$$

- What does it sound like?
- What do you notice about the relationship between these pitches and those of the overtone series?

## The Incipient Tonality Diamond

- A little confusing since Partch talks about "going down" from $\frac{1}{1}$
- Chords going $\nearrow$ sound as otonal; chords going $\nwarrow$ sound as utonal.

How does one actually deal with something like a tonality diamond with confronted with "real" instruments?

Japanese microtonal pop?
