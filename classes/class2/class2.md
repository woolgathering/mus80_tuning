## Today's Class
- Brief coverage of the reading
  - Some terminology: diesis, superparticular, other useless junk
  - Questions?
- Pythagoras vs. Aristoxenus
  - Two varying approaches in ancient Greece
  - Constructing a tetrachord
- __Analysis__: Olympos' Pentatonic
- __Analysis__: Archytas' Enharmonic

---
## Reading
- Diesis: basically a comma
  - In the case of Barbour, it is the comma produced between an octave and three stacked 5:4 intervals.
    - Lesser diesis: 128:125 or about 41.06 cents
- Superparticular: a ratio in which the numerator is greater than the denominator by 1; i.e. 3:2, 5:4, 6:5, 8:7, etc.
  - Not really used that much outside Barbour to describe Ptolemy

---

#### Moving up & down using ratios
- To go up, multiply. To go down, divide (i.e. multiply by the reciporical)
- You can find the interval between two ratios by dividing the larger by the smaller.

# Pythagoras vs. Aristoxenus
Mathemetics vs. the Music

---

The Greeks creating tunings by dividing a string into equal parts.

<!-- _footer: Note how this is related to the harmonic series -->

#### Constructing a Tetrachord

What is a tetrachord?
- A set of four notes tuned within the interval 4:3.
  - Pythagorean: using only 4:3 and 3:2 to get new notes (a prime factor of 3).
- Two of these sets were often separated by a "tone" to make an octave.

#### Definition of a "tone" in Pythagorean terms
The interval between 4:3 and 3:2.

$$
\frac{3}{2} \div \frac{4}{3}  = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{8}
$$

#### Let's make a scale from two tetrachords separated by a tone

## Listening

<br/>
- Olympos was a 6th century BC flutist and lyre player.

### Olympos Pentatonic

A pentatonic scale using only 3:2 and 5:4 (i.e. not Pythagorean!)

![height:200](/home/jacob/Documents/jacob/jobs/tuning/classes/class2/olymposPentatonic.png)

Note that the scale starts _not_ on 1:1 (i.e. it's a mode). This scale also appears in koto tunings (Japanese stringed instrument).

<!-- _footer: A pentatonic scale is a scale made up of five notes. -->
