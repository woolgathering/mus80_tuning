## Today's Class
- What is equal temperament?
  -  Historical precedents: Bali, China
- Easy math, hard to tune
- Common types of equal temperament
  - 12-tone, 19-tone, 24-tone, 31-tone
- Ezra Sims: AGP174

### Equal Temperament
- Equal division of the octave
- Known throughout history but not often used in the West until recently
- Used (closely) in China, Java, and other parts of Asia
- Essentially a system of approximation

### 12-Tone Equal Temperament
- The dominant system of tuning in the West
- Essentially, it is a Pythagorean scale with each fifth tempered by 1/12 of a Pythagorean comma
- If $s$ is the ratio of a semitone, then:

$$
s \times s \times s \times s \times s \times s \times s \times s \times s \times s \times s \times s = s^{12} = 2 \\
s = \sqrt[12]{2}
$$

So the ratio of each semitone is a twelfth root of two. But how did we figure this out before accurate means of measuring frequency?

#### The Geometric Mean
Recall that the geometric mean is defined as the $n$th root of the product of $n$ numbers. Before calculators, we needed to use visual or mechanical means to calculate.

### 24-tone Equal Temperament
- $s = \sqrt[24]{2}$
- Simply, these are quarter-tones and are very common in contemporary music.
- They even have their own accidentals: ![height:190](https://www.rpmseattle.com/of_note/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/03_QT_Symbols-500x171.png)

### Javanese Music
- Gamelan music
- Two main types of scales
  - Pelog (subset of 9-tone equal temperament (roughly))
  - Slendro
    - Typically thought of as an 5-tone equal temperament, though [this paper](https://thewinnower.com/papers/2861-an-analysis-of-a-gamelan-slendro-tuning) calls that into question, though the author only analyzed one set of instruments in one ensemble.
    - Perhaps better approximated by 7-limit just intonation.
- __Listen:__ [KPH Notoprojo: Lancaran Orde Baru, pelog barang ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X4bzUI77sE)

---
### 19-tone equal temperament
- $s = \sqrt[19]{2}$
- Sounds weird but actually works out well.
- Has very close to just ($\frac{6}{5}$) minor thirds (less than 1 cent off).
- Can use the same Western system of notation, only accidentals are different notes (Ab ≠ G#), except for those notes which are directly adjacent, a note is added (E - E#/Fb - F).

### 31-tone Equal Temperament
- - $s = \sqrt[31]{2}$
- Actually appeared quite early.
  - The fifth of meantone (1/4 comma) is almost exactly the same as the fifth in 31-TeT.
  - Christiaan Huygens (17th century) wrote specifically on 31-TeT.
- __Listen:__ [Fabio Costa: ...and while there he sighs... (2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSgGgb7y-F8)
  - Played on the Fokker Organ

<!-- _class: invert -->
- To the right is one octave on the Fokker Organ.
- Note the different note names and how the colors correspond to the colors of the piano (except blue).
- Some notational systems employ the quarter-tone notation but there is no enharmonicity.

#### 31-TeT (continued)
By using subsets (modes) of the 31edo system one is able to approximate many different tunings:
- 1/4 comma meantone
  - 31-TeT has the property such that four stacked fifths are equal to two octaves plus a $\frac{5}{4}$.
- Closely approximates 11edo
- Vicentino's usual Archiembalo  tuning
- 7-limit just intonation (to a degree)
- Euler-Fokker Genera (Thursday or next week)

### Are equal divisions of the octave a "cheat"?
