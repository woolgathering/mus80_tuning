## Today's Class
- What is well-temperament? How is it different than meantone?
- Bach: The Well-Tempered Clavier, Books I+II (1722, 1742)
  - Written in all 24 major and minor keys
  - What did Bach's temperament sound like for this work?
    - Competing theories (some more dubious than others)
- Bach according to Werckmeister
- Bach according to Lehman
- Assignment 3

### Well-temperament
- Essentially, it is a category of temperaments that allow performance in all keys (i.e. no wolf interval).
- Limited to 12 notes (as opposed to meantone which need not be limited)
- Unequal enough that keys can still have a "mood" (debatable).

## Bach's _Well-Tempered Clavier, Books I+II_

- Preludes and fugues written in all 24 major and minor keys.
- [Víkingur Ólafsson – Bach: Prelude & Fugue in C minor, BWV 847 | WTC Book I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGVL5j6BEKs)

### Bach's Well-Temperament according to not-Bach
- Werckmeister
- Lehman
- O'Donnell
- Hill
- Barnes
- Swich
- Louie

---
### Werckmeister (1691)
- Four kinds of temperaments!
- Fifth-based tuning (much like meantone)
- Did not specify whether the comma was syntonic ($\frac{81}{80}$) or Pythagorean ($\frac{​531441}{524288}$ or approx. $\frac{74}{73}$).
- Werckmeister III is the best known and most used.
  - Fifths based on D-A, A-E, F♯-C♯, C♯-G♯, and F-C are narrow by 1/4 comma
  - The fifth between G#-D# is wide by 1/4 comma
  - Every other fifth is pure.

### Lehman (2005)

Claimed to have deciphered an anomalous squiggle on the title page of the Well-Tempered Clavier (seen above).

Procedure:
1.) Flip the illustration over and read it backwards.
2.) Tune the 5 fifths C – G – D – A – E – B short by 2/12 of the Pythagorean comma.
3.) The fifths B – F# – C# – G# as “pure” ($\frac{3}{2}$)
4.) The 3 fifths G# (Ab) – Eb – Bb – F short by 1/12 of the Pythagorean comma.

# Real Question
Does it actually matter?
